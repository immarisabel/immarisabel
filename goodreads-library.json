How we all process grief and the regret that belongs to it all along. But it is so dragging to get to those heartfelt moments, that I always felt nothing by the time I got to them. And havinga  new character every 10 pages was also draining. No connection... I only made a connection to the ones about Flinch and Clara because I am a mother.",

   "My Review": "This was so so beautiful. It was the kind of writing style I always envisioned to have. The kind of writing style which drags you, word y word, filling every inch of your lungs, until it leaves you breathless. For a moment, I wanted Luc to be real, real love, for a moment, I believed he was. And even with that ending, I still wish, part of me hopes, he still is. Even though realistically, he‚Äôs not. And I guess that was the whole point, that was the enchantment Schwab instilled upon us with her beautiful, calculated prose. She bewitched us into thinking it was possible. And even though I root for Addie to win, part of me feels bad for Luc. And that is why this was such a good story.",

   "My Review": "*A story about forgiving the past.*<br/><br/>I do not believe an audiobook was the best choice for this book. Though Tom Hanks as narrator is superb!<br/><br/>The timelines jump so much, I felt slightly dizzy sometimes trying to wrap my brains around the narration. I believe in the book, I would have gotten those empty spaces to help. But here, there was a second between scene, making it seem it was still the same scene, just to fall into the actual one like jumping through dream scenes. It was wild. <br/><br/>The story itself was nice, but it is more like an autobiography. For those complaining of no plot, you missed the story. The plot was always Daniel‚Äôs dreams, which all begun with his father and the Dutch House. The characters were good, but not amazing. The prose, though, the prose! The writing style is breathtaking, and I can see why so many people love this book. I can savor each word, and I am sad the library did not have the book available for me to read along.<br/><br/>The plot progressed in random jumps... chapter ends, chapter start with first few lines with a new event. For a while I had the feeling Maeve and Celeste were in love before Maeve pushed her into Daniel. In the end, when all comes in full circle, it is truly a story about forgiveness at its very core. About how no one is exempt from mistakes and tragedy and that should not hold us from enjoying life, the way May always did. It feels May was the embodiment of the resolution. A clean slate for the family. Enjoying life, and not caring about the past, but about moving forward.",

   "My Review": "This is my kind of book.  A mix of Historical fiction and Scifi. These were amazing characters. Incredible narration. Flowing prose, just so gentle and dreamy.<br/><br/>The reason for the memories was unexpected and certainly the end, and what they did with Halley‚Äôs eggs was something I was not expecting. Which is something not all books can give me lately. I love love loved this book so much. The adventures, the journey, I felt like I lived them myself. The beauty of the now in contrast to the memories. Memories are but a tool in the end, not something to make you feel despair or rage, or joy. But a tool to help you survive in the future and help you realize the beauty of the now.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>",

As much as I loved the previous one, I am too familiar with such dystopian stories to figure out what is next.<br/><br/>I did found it, and compulsively bought it. I read it, though slow at first, it managed to hold my attention. I was not thrilled, but entertained. I was not sad, but upset with her. At first with her monologues. The, at her and her endless mean and selfish ways. At her and her selfish heart blinded to those around her, disguised in courage and pride.<br/><br/>I wished with every single page that Maven did cared about her in the end, just being manipulated by his evil mother. In the end my hopes crumbled. The void filled with uncertainty about whether or not I will read the final instalment. Wondering whether I should care or not whether she lives or not. At this point, I would not mind the last.",

   "My Review": "There is a beautiful madness in this book.<br/><br/>Cooper is a fat gay New Yorker who wakes up somehow in the City Unspoken, a city where mortals and gods come to die. A concept which will leave you amazed once you grasp the meaning of it. The plot is difficult to understand if you are of the impatient kind. But once you do you will feel the need to continue.<br/><br/>The end of death is coming and everyone will drown in their own madness. The true plot here is a deeper one on life and death, the way each character face this and their immortality. This leads us to complex characters from which even those appearing in one mere scene have you wishing to know more about them. The phase is constant and the views constantly change. Much like movie scenes.<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed this book. Is my kind of book and I am certain it is not everyone's kind. It is not a mainstream read, nor is it meant for you to connect on a personal level to anyone but the worlds. But these kind of stories are what I consider forsaken and underestimated jewels. I never marked a book so much with so many flags and sticky notes. I would not have minded if it was 600 pages long.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://blog.marisabelmunoz.com/2015/08/the-waking-engine-by-david-edison.html\">Original Review</a>",

   "My Review": "It is really had to review this book. Specially since I have very mixed feelings about it. I will not comment on the writing since it‚Äôs genius and beautiful and shiny and filled with words I truly can not comprehend unless I read them three times. Now onto the review. At first I was very enthusiastic with the idea of it. The magical realism, the white horse, the love and the eternal winter. I was followed by disappointment, then again amazement, then disappointment. Peter Lake was a wonderful character which I would have loved if he had more talking lines. But most of his scenes are mere action and description of all he saw. His romance with Beverly was beautiful, short and sad, she is not given that much scenes or lines either. She becomes a sort of ghost for most of the book, which is sad. Her family however takes up the rest of the story.<br/><br/>I have to say the description of the book is very very misleading. It is not a story about love, it is a story about winter, machines, lakes in the clouds and a god-like white horse. There is some time travel involved, which I understood from the very first description of the cloud. Somewhere in the book, if you push enough to get there, one of the characters explain what the cloud is and what it isn't. It makes sense if you like the whole idea of how some thing just will remain a mystery forever, like what‚Äôs inside a black hole. No matter what you can theorize, or study, or even send, you never get the full answer. The antagonist, was well made as a balanced character, and you can deduct by the text who he really is and what the book in the end is about. Which I won‚Äôt give away. These are the reasons you must read such books and forget about silly movie remakes which have nothing to do with the actual novel.<br/><br/>There were some moments in the book where I found myself reading and happily enjoying. Other parts just got me grumpy through the day, like pointless history on the newspaper battle or the three pages of how people skate on the frozen lake. At some point I gave up and began just skimming them. The story develops further with the secondary characters, plenty of randomness and snow. Annoyance at the whole thing, a few struggles not to give up, the horse again‚Ä¶ pointlessly like a god. Random luck strikes (it seems every single character in this book is lucky except for Beverly). The end was as confusing as the book. Though at about page 600 I felt back to where I started. I was enjoying it though it didn't make much sense and there is much I can‚Äôt write here without spoiling it.<br/><br/>I did not enjoyed this book as much as I hoped, because there was no plot, the description was misleading (I constantly waited for Beverly to reappear just to be disappointed like a child who gets a hot-wheel while he wanted a control remote monster truck.) and there word cold was repeated without limit through the book. I do not recommend it (except for the writing) nor the movie. Unless you want to study about descriptive narrative, then is one of the best I've read, beautiful, crazy, confusing, a through and through ride of senses and lack of emotions. Though there, the author focused more on the descriptive so the emotions seemed forced.",

   "My Review": "The Book of Tomorrow Before you continue reading, my review might contain a spoiler or two. Mainly those I find pointless.The reason I wanted to read this book is because I&#039;m an avid journalist, in the most write-my-own-personal-journals-diligently-for-over-ten-years way. As soon as I saw a book about a magical journal I had to read it. Luckily for me the library here had it, pocket size! So I carried it around for a week in my pocket literally, reading it every chance I could get. I have to plead guilty that I skipped a few pages because well... I hate overly descriptive scenes. But the book had only about 2 of those as time connectors, which is understandable and acceptable, I just don&#039;t like reading those.The first thing I thought when I started the book was &quot;oh great, another was-a-princess teenager girl with an attitude as the main character.&quot; Honestly, a lot of books are trying to stay away from sweet naive girl heroines clich&eacute;s and falling into just another clich&eacute;. But even though I beginning to notice these clich&eacute;, Tamara was a well written character. The story elements were nice and the family drama was entangling and exiting.Read full review at my blog.",

And the way her family support her was amazing since I was getting tired of the \"my family will never accept this\" plot in most romances. So this was actually refreshing. I'm going to definitely pick up the next book!",

   "My Review": "This book is the first of the dystopian trilogy. Even though the whole massive dystopian trend is getting over-done (aka: boring), I still felt attracted to this book because of the character. Human and evolving, not a whining damsel in distress and (thanks to all the goodness in the Universe and Veronica‚Äôs wits) no-love-triangle. The character is Tris, whom at 16 must choose one of 5 factions in which this futuristic Chicago society is divided. The five are Dauntless, Amity, Erudite, Abnegation and Candor. Dauntless, the one she chose, promotes the value of courage. Tris chose this even though her true results were ‚ÄúDivergent‚Äù, which meant she could belong to any of three and her mind and will is stronger than the rest, thus being dangerous for the powers-that-be in a society where they want to control everyone. She is not the only one, which are kudos points for Veronica. Nothing about the ‚Äúyou are the one‚Äù subject. <br/><br/>The book is fast phased and fun. A long initiation ritual filled with conspiracies and Tris‚Äô struggles with her identity. The fact that she needs to belong somewhere, stopping her from becoming who she wants and is supposed to be, and how she overcome this (though tragic) made this story worthy of my time. Her emotions were complicated and real. She was both selfish and unselfish, a coward and brave, a liar and honest, sweet and bitchy. The romance was light and strong, like the perfect amount at the perfect moments. Sure you puke a bit at the end, but hey, let her write what she wants. I still liked it. The way Tobias supported Tris‚Äô strength instead of feeling the need to protect her, was an amazing way of showing how love should be. <br/><br/>The whole society itself in a way don‚Äôt make sense, I have to admit. It‚Äôs a bit stupid how they came up with such rules. But, again, it‚Äôs fiction, so chill about it. Just imagine is the only way the world could be and enjoy the ride. That is the point of these dystopian stories, what if. What if a society is divided in attributes rather than money or power, or even hierarchy? What if you must choose one or live disconnected form the whole world forever? And what if the revolutionary time arrives and the characters need to confront the fact that all those attributes combined are stronger than just one? What if they realize, they are just all humans with one simple goal, to belong? ",

   "My Review": "John Saturnall is the heir to a legacy of cooks. The first women and men who enjoyed the endless feast provided by the Garden of Eden.  The story begins with John as a boy, all the hardships and his talented nose. But then the story changes after his mother dies in the winter‚Äôs cold. He is brought to Lord William‚Äôs manor. Joins the kitchen and war explodes. All in-between friendship and romance plots.<br/><br/>Long ago I saw a Korean drama, ‚ÄúFeast of the Gods‚Äù. It was a family drama revolving around centuries of cooking and a very talented girl with a talented nose. The main character rose to the top through hardship and tests. In the end, she decided to go back to her simple life she loved, free to cook whatever she wanted. Where am I going with this? Well, I was expecting the same kind of trill from John Saturnall‚Äôs Feast. Alas, it did not come close. Also, the witch piece of the story reminded me much of the story I am working on. So I was also expecting some inspiration. Again, none.<br/><br/>The story began quite well. I began having questions and cheered for John against the bullies. The story took up phase. Jumping between past and present, which I enjoyed. I was expecting this to be much like ‚ÄúThe Language of Flowers.‚Äù Then the mother died and the story began to die with her. Endless pages about John surviving. Followed by endless pages of traveling. Followed by endless pages of well‚Ä¶ cooking. I don‚Äôt know why I expected so much about this book, and the one thing I should have expected, I didn‚Äôt. The cooking. So much cooking. So many things I didn‚Äôt understood.<br/><br/>The romance began fun, as kids, hating each other. But the attraction was as sudden and random as the war itself. Through the book, there are no signs of an incoming war, until a sudden moment. The romance, though well built up, was just emotionless. At least for me. I didn‚Äôt felt it. I didn‚Äôt loved the characters. I only cheered for Lucretia‚Äôs fighting spirit.<br/><br/>And the last bit of the book. Suddenly made me feel like I was in a vortex wondering where the hell I ended up at, dizzy, confused, and trying to make sense of it. Turned out 12 years went by in the blink of an eye. Yes, a blink, literally. One paragraph ends up with heartbreak and the next is 12 years later.<br/><br/>I would have enjoyed this book if it had better breaks between time periods. And less plots all over the place coming out of nowhere. Much often I found myself going back to see how many years went by. Suddenly the boy I met had grey hair. His journey to become a Master Chef was an easy breeze. The romance was sneaky and sad, so that part was good, just lifeless. As if no one in the household would have noticed their romance during the hunger and war. Please.<br/><br/>The one thing I enjoyed were the recipes in-between. Supposedly dividing chapters that were just scattered. But were written with a prose which in my head read as if it was indeed John reciting them. The whole book was a sort of metaphor for Lucretia and John‚Äôs romance and centuries of disputes between the original people of the Vale and the Invaders. But it seemed to focus more on the metaphor and the kitchen than in the characters. This disappointed me. I rated it 2 stars and that‚Äôs a gift. I didn‚Äôt liked it in the end. Though after long years, with a sudden disappearance form the archenemy (surprise surprise), they reunite again in a feast and a happily ever after.<br/>",

I think this is the last chance I give to one of his books. After The Source Field and Synchronicity is the key, I feel the rest is just rewording his main ideas for continued sales...",

The story is taking way too long to make sense, half of the pages are just descriptions of what they ate and smell. They smell everything. So many smells. And then I read some reviews to see if I was the only one. No.<br/><br/>This did it for me:<br/>‚ÄúThe air was hot and humid. It seemed to squat over the yard and buildings like a malignant Buddha.‚Äù<br/><br/>What?!<br/><br/>Enough. I‚Äôm going to the library.<br/><br/>I still count it to my total as I read almost half of it.",

   "My Review": "What a ride! I thought I would get bored of the conflict and characters dying. But then they didn‚Äôt die and things started to become exciting as they attempt to survive. The moment of Juliette on Silo 17 kept me biting my nails (figuratively) and it was always feeling so claustrophobic. Her situation reminded me a lot of some of my nightmares so it was hard to read but I pushed through it. I loved the characters, oh Lukas, I loved him the most.<br/><br/>I was not surprised at the reason for all of this happening but it does make you think what would desperate idealistic people would do for survival and hope this does not happen at all.",

   "My Review": "The Gracekeeper is one of those mystical and beautiful novels which transport you into another kind of world. The oceans have devoured the earth, leaving groups of islands around the world to fend for themselves. People divided in land and sea. Trees are sacred, wood is the new high currency and mammals as well as crops of any kind are in high demand and only available to a lucky few. Such as North's bear, one of the main characters.<br/><br/>Callanish, a land girl in charge of resting the dead, meets North, a sea girl with a bear. Is hard to write a review without going into spoilers. So let me just say this, it is worth it. The world is beautifully constructed and the characters are deep. There is no real bad or good guy. They are are survivors in a world that is hard to live in. And they all want one thing, love. In any possible, horrible, beautiful and surreal way.<br/><br/>At first I though it was just Callanish and North's voices. But then we started to read short chapters on other secondary characters, which made the story more interesting and added extra dept. You can compare it to the Night Circus's prose on wonderful things, but then with a touch of -Station Eleven's hope for a different future and adaptation- approach. It has a charm of it's own. It talks about love and family and home, and how we can build it, instead of waiting for someone to do it for us. And how we can adapt to an ever changing earth which is the only home we will ever have.<br/><br/>My final thought: if she is back at her graceyard, then wouldn't the messenger ever go back to her? I really felt he loved her truly. These kind of stories go on in your heart after you turn the last page.",

   "My Review": "I write this piece with a bit of shame, also with a bit of pride, if that makes sense. I have to confess I do not rave over romance books. Though I do like romance, the exaggerated ideal of it in some books makes me cringe. My expectations for The Bronze Horseman by Paullina Simons were quite high; a sin I often commit when choosing what to read and of which I am trying to distance from. However, this book presented with a lot of promises, and at some point some failed to deliver. I state in advance, this is not a bad book, it is not, it just presents at some point that part of ideal romance books that I dread so much. So to summarize it, my heart was divided in this book. Keep reading to find out why, stop if you don‚Äôt want to be spoiled of the feelings I am about to share.<br/><br/>Full review at my blog.",

   "My Review": "I was close not to finish this. And I did skimmed a lot through the last 1/4 of the book. It was less than I expected it to be. There was no lyrical prose about it. There was chaotic wording from Aza's mind, repeating words. Repeating. Repeating even things she could not say.<br/><br/>Aza was too morbid for my liking. Sure she was dying, but how the first whole half of the book was just about death got me a bit down. By the time I reached the middle I was sighing in annoyance at the giant big birds I could not phantom in my mind. I tried to use The Neverending Story movie to imagine some of it. But I failed more than often. If my brain cannot process what I read, I pretty much give up on it.<br/><br/>I still wanted to see how she returns home. Kind of hoping this whole ship and giant birds thing was a whole hallucination of her mind and the story turns out to be some deep life metaphor. Not. Jason's irrational search for her made me go, \"UGH!\" He is supposed to be a rational genius and here we see him without nay issues immediately looking for Magonia. It would have been more believable if he saw it first.<br/><br/>The plot indeed was all over the place, I won't get into it as I don't want to give out spoilers. But I didn't liked the characters, I did not liked the concept and the whole first half morbid part. It was like reading a dream journal of a teenager with psychosis. Random bits here and there not making sense. I was expecting more of it. It did not lived up to the hype. Hence I don't trust hypes. But I trusted Neil Gaiman. I guess their marketing strategy of having a dear author praising the book worked here. And though Neil Gaiman's books are comparable, they make much more sense because of the writing style. This book was just not well executed with the prose.<br/>",

   "My Review": "Michel Faber didn‚Äôt published a book for 10 years, it made me wonder if he was on extended holidays or just taking his time writing this wonderful book. I never heard of him before, but I was curious if it was a new author so I did some research. He wasn‚Äôt, he was just out of the scene for longer than I‚Äôve been reading.<br/><br/>The book begins with a man and a wife who relationship is deeply bonded in love; for each other, Jesus and the world. What stroked me is how well developed these characters were. I even felt sorry for the absent wife, I felt every pain as I read her emails and sorry and angry at the same time at Peter. I was expecting a lot of fanatic religion and annoying moralist characters, but no. These were real human beings trying hard to keep and share their faith, with their own doubts and guilt‚Äôs. I have to say the religious factor in this book was perfect, not pushy and yet integral to the story.<br/><br/>When Peter, the main character, encounters the natives of Oasis they hit me as creepy and I was pretty sure something creepy was going to happen. But no, these creatures are also as real as we are all the more reason for me to keep reading. It was amazing how Faber managed to keep these natives different and yet similar to humans. At some point I thought of them as adorably creepy.<br/><br/>The writing style was fluid and every single scene was worth reading until the very end; which even though a bit short for me, was well satisfying. Stating how a good book does not have to end and can go on in your imagination. A story, a real story has no ending, but a new beginning. The open end and the questions I had left made me wonder if the author was planning a sequel. I hope not really. The world was so perfect; the characters so real, I think a sequel might ruin this effect.<br/><br/>All in all, an unexpected amazing read!",

My instinct is usually right when it comes to buying books compulsively. This time as well. I was expecting something entirely different. This novel was filled with political and conspiracy plots. More than just about division of races. More than just love triangles. I lived and loved every page. I was afraid of the hype, but it did not let me down.<br/><br/>The characters were perfectly imperfect. They betrayed me as well, I loved them and hated them as much afterwards. So twisted. All of them with their own motivations, desires and goals. They played their own games individually. Mare was perfectly imperfect, a bit more and she would have cross the line to unrealistic character. Thankfully she did not and it was awesome! Same with the others. Though she is your typically YA heroine, and you typical dystophian plot, of which I am more than often tired of, the twisted plots around her and the world building kept me reading.<br/><br/>It lives up to its hype. It is full with action and emotions. Emotions which will tear you apart or make you want to tear apart some of the characters. You feel the love, the longing, the betrayals. I read it quite fast as it keeps moving, making you want to read it all in one go. I highly recommend it and am definitely looking forward to the second book. Also, I see this book being turned into a movie eventually. Just hoping it does not disappoint me as the story develops.",

   "My Review": "I've had my eyes on this book for a while. And it was quite the refreshment after going through Helprin‚Äôs Winter‚Äôs Tale. I enjoyed it from the beginning. The voice was nice and quirky with familiar references for geeky people like me. This is a tradition against technology book, the secondary theme I won‚Äôt give it away or it will ruin the mystery. The characters were fun to read and it reminded me of those books I used to read when I was a kid where all the characters helped each other and came together to accomplish a mission.<br/><br/>Clay is your typical designer who needs a job because they all do. A job is something precious after a depression, even if that job involves staying up all night running a bookstore which is only visited by very strange fellows. This tickles Clay‚Äôs curiosity and he is set up to figure things out. Who are these people? What is in those books? It started as a hobby to survive the dreadful hours of the night without going insane. But it became much more.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the book there is a particular line that will remain forever in me, which is much to say about books that are not meant to be deep:<br/><br/>‚ÄúEach big idea like that is an operating system upgrade,‚Äùshe says, smiling. ‚ÄúWriters are responsible for some of it. They say Shakespeare invented the internal monologue.‚Äù<br/>It got me thinking, our reality has been imagined before it happened. I still remember ‚ÄúThe Time Machine‚Äù by H. G. Wells with all their tablets during a school trip. Back then that was just imagination. Now, it‚Äôs becoming a reality, where all the kids have some sort of communication device. The same goes for society, in a way, invented and evolved by big ideas from creative minds which often turn out to be writers imagining a different kind of world. More than the whole other subject, I think this idea was the most profound one in this book. Because it doesn't have the kind of prose I love but yet captured me in enjoyment, 4 full stars.",

   "My Review": "This is a book filled with beautiful enchanting prose. Strange events and stranger people through four generations of women and their love demises. From the first line until the very end, you are taken inside this beautiful melody of a story. Even the characters' names were both beautiful and strange. I began reading with an expectation in mind, a love story, a boy falling for an angel. I got an amazing story of love and sorrows which broke my heart over and over again for each and every character, except for Wilhemina. I think she was the only sane one, serving as their healer and guide. The way how she helped them process their sorrows in the end was an amazing touch. I can not talk much about this book without giving much away. Lets just say my new moleskine reading journal started with a bang and 6 pages filled with all the emotions this book cause me to have.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to reading more books from Leslye Walton and I might include her in my favorite authors list along with Sarah Addison Allen and Neil Gaiman.",

   "My Review": "I got this book through NetGalley. I applied to it since I have written journals since I was 13 and I am always curious when a journal gets published. To my surprise, this was not a written journal, but an illustrated journal. It is hard for me to review this as I was expecting some story, well, the conventional type at least. The book is just random, as random as it could get without loosing coherence. It start with innocence, and ends in love and heartbreaks and life. I found myself wondering why am I even looking at it, as soon as I click it as ‚Äòread‚Äô on my goodreads account it felt I was cheating on my year goal. But I have to admit, it had me giggling and looking back on my own teen days and my own journals. There was a lot I could relate to. So in a way it did grab me as a reader, ehm, art appreciator. And I love doodles. It is cute and witty and it will make you giggle.",

   "My Review": "I first encountered Sara Addison Allen when my boyfriend found a book that looked written just for me. Whatever with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt judge a book by its cover‚Äù. I judged that book by its cover and title; ‚ÄòThe Girl Who Chased the Moon‚Äô. I loved it. This is the second book I read from this writer, and now she has become one of my favorite.<br/><br/>‚ÄòLost Lake‚Äô is about Kate and Devin, and all the characters included. Kate woke up from her long sad dream when her husband died and after her daughter finds an old postcard, she decides to go on an adventure in search of the happiness she once knew, to offer it to her daughter before they are both tied in the miserable life with her mother-in-law. Sometimes you go through life finding a place to fit in. In Kate‚Äôs case, she found it when she was 12, but she never knew it was it until she returned 15 years later. Lost Lake was about to be sold and all the residences knew, it was their home, every summer, new stories were born.<br/><br/>I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this book. It connects you to each character, each story, each ending. It drags you back and forward making you feel happy and sad for them. The story is not just about Kate or Devin, but about all the people who found family and home every summer at Lost Lake. Just like with all her other novels, Sarah makes an amazing job making us feel for each of the characters. Every time you think it is a secondary character, she offers you their story, and suddenly they become more important and real. It is almost like reading 20 stories in one.<br/><br/>Another factor I love from her writing is that even though it‚Äôs a contemporary story, it always involves a spark of magic. The kind that makes you believe in it. The kind that makes you think, ‚Äúyes, this might have happen in real life.‚Äù The kind that makes you looks around you and try to find that spark of magic in your own life. The kind that makes you believe that maybe after we are gone, we are not really gone, but we become something else, something more, something we wished for the most.<br/><br/>This story is about hope and the chance to start over and rewrite your ending. After I began reading the novel, I read some reviews. It took me by surprise that when Sarah wrote this novel, she was going through a breast cancer fight. It is her statement, ‚Äúthis is my story, and I write the ending.‚Äù<br/><br/>Amazing book. Amazing characters. Amazing writer. Five out of five stars of course. ‚ô•",

   "My Review": "This is the first review of my 2014 reading challenge.<br/><br/>I remember when I saw the cover of this book. I fell in love with it and the name. I mean, you got to love such a romantic fantasy name such as Seraphina. I began reading this book in 2012. Back when I was starting to read more frequently thanks to my newly acquired Kobo Touch. But it turned out to be too incomprehensible for my brain and English vocabulary level at that moment. So I let it sit until 2 years later and at about 15 books later.<br/><br/>The reading now was easier, but not without effort. I usually dislike epic fantasies. Their complex wording and endless hard-to-pronounce names and plot tangles. But yet, Seraphina offered me that touch of epic fantasy  world, beautiful characters and intrigue when it comes to their inner world. I won't comment on the politics as it's not my strongest point. Seraphina is narrated in first person. She is a savant musician half dragon with strange abilities. I have to admit, were it not for the visions she had of the others, I would have lost quick interest. Trying to figure out who was Fruit Bat kept me reading. And his appearance at the end didn't disappointed me at all. The secondary character, princess Gliselda, surprised me also at how I grew fond of her while in her first appearance I hated her. World building was perfect. One of the few reasons I continued to read.<br/><br/>The rest of the novel itself is very slow phased. I felt I was struggling with a heavy rock on my back trying to reach the tipping point, to which once I arrived, felt like I was rushing down the hill. Some of the dialog dragged with elaborated descriptions on their surrounding. The wording choice is not for light readers. I found myself getting lost a lot between reading, understanding what I was reading and trying to pronounce words I never heard before. I'm pretty sure my brain didn't process a lot while struggling.<br/><br/>Romance was sudden, hurried and illogical. The plot picks up in the last 25% of the book. With a promise that some people might love for the future of the series, while others -like me- might not. I'm pretty certain the next book will involve more politics and war, less on character development. I do expect to see how they grow into their roles. But I might end up skipping long political talk pages.<br/><br/>I do recommend this book if your vocabulary is higher than mine. The reason I scored it 3 stars is because of it constant drag and slow phase reading. As well as the unnecessary romance plot. You will probably follow it better than I did. It is well written. The development is good, though slow. And the characters are well done. The romance was pointless in my opinion. But that's just me. Maybe it serves as a starting point for next book. I'm just glad that I stick to finish this book once and for all.",

   "My Review": "SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>If you haven‚Äôt read the novel yet, do not read this review. Don‚Äôt let my opinion spoil you some good writing. As for plot‚Ä¶ meh.<br/><br/>First thing, the good. Ever since I read ‚ÄúThe lovely bones‚Äù by Alice Sebold, I‚Äôve been searching for a book that takes me into this wonderful world of words (W.W.W.). In this world words play in your head like music in May. They make you feel and shed a tear or two. The way language is used is touching, inspiring, sad and happy at the same time. Forth came ‚ÄúThe Age of Miracles‚Äù. And I have to say, Karen has mastered words. The book is so beautifully written that, like another reviewer said,‚Äùmakes you want to write down a quote every few pages.‚Äù My favorite quote is simply this one:<br/><br/>I still remember the flyers that appeared in post offices and grocery stores; names and photos of people soon hung from the same signposts that had previously carried the new of lost pets. If you see this woman, please tell her Daniel is looking for her. If you‚Äôre out there, J. T., here‚Äôs my number. It was the newest relationships that were the least likely to survive‚Äîmillions of new connections were cut off in midbloom. Think of all those potential loved ones lost once again on a planet of strangers.<br/><br/>So what is it about? The story is about a girl named Julia who is coming to age in an ever-slowing world. The setting in my view is a sort of mirror of Julia‚Äôs own world. How her first love also grew slowly, how everything in her life changed. She learned how things are more complicated than an ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù or an ‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù. The world slows down more each day, days are longer and warmer, nights are also longer and colder. So does her family and her life. I loved how her relationship with Seth came to be, casual and innocent. I hated how all the situations around her came to nothing. Including the end of the world. Slowly, prolonging, into nothing.<br/><br/>Science was the biggest set back. But I guess if you actually set this drama in a realistic slowing earth setting, the characters would be dead in day one. I guess. If you don‚Äôt want the science to keep you from reading do not watch Aftermath by National Geographic over the slowing of the Earth. It will have you going ‚ÄúWhat the frack‚Äù as often as ‚ÄúAh, that‚Äôs a nice line‚Äù.  By her 72 hours spin, they should be all dead. Ten years later, they are not.<br/><br/>So I waited for that asteroid to come when they started to talk about the weakening of the magnetic field. And I waited. And Seth left. And I waited. And her family was back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. And I waited. And suddenly it was as if she decided to take a last breath and tell us about her last ten years in the last ten pages. And I waited‚Ä¶ and nothing. And that was that. A slow novel about slowing growing up in an ever slowing world and then‚Ä¶ bam! Fast forward and you go like ‚ÄúWhat? Wait! I‚Äôm still here!‚Äù The end.<br/><br/>So to conclude, I do recommend the novel to those who appreciate beautiful words. To those who appreciate action and drama and tension and all that jazz, not so much. I‚Äôm in between. I‚Äôm glad I read it. There were beautiful lines in it. I mean, think of my favorite quote. Not long ago we were distant, relying on letters and time to connect to each other. Wars came and the distance stretched. Now, we sit her and instantly talk to each other. I can call my family on the other side of the globe whereas in the past I would have become a daughter in ink. All the potential loves, including mine, would have never come to be. What would happen if such a time come again? I would be heartbroken for all the hearts that would break.",
