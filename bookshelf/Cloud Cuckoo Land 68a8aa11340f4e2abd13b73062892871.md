It seems everyone connected to different characters.

I loved them all except Zeno, even though he was the most important one towards the end.

The whole idea felt like poetry to me. Like a concept, displayed in the whole book. Unable to explain it without having to read the book. The owl was the symbolism for stories and wisdom accross the ages. The evolution of Seymor was perfect. He wanted to give something back to the children he took Zeno from. So he gave them the books, single enditions. Hence they are not in Atlas. Though that part was weird. He was in charge of Atlas and the book was not there? That does not make sense.

But I loved the second half of the book. I am glad I dragged through the first.

Ana and Omeir‚Äôs story sound super similar to ‚ÄúAll the Lights we cannot see‚Äù.
