I enjoyed the premise of the multiverse. I got a bit bored with the historic details like for a 3rd of the book. But outside of that, I kept wondering what will happen. Like the continuation of Ultima I've been looking for. Want to read the second book. But will give it a break. Else I probably skip a lot. I already read it is quite dragging. But I am still curious about where the journey will take them.

And then, like serendipity, youtube recommends me this one.
