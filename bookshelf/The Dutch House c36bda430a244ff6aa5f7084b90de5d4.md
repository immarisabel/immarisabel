*A story about forgiving the past.*

I do not believe an audiobook was the best choice for this book. Though Tom Hanks as narrator is superb!

The timelines jump so much, I felt slightly dizzy sometimes trying to wrap my brains around the narration. I believe in the book, I would have gotten those empty spaces to help. But here, there was a second between scene, making it seem it was still the same scene, just to fall into the actual one like jumping through dream scenes. It was wild.

The story itself was nice, but it is more like an autobiography. For those complaining of no plot, you missed the story. The plot was always Daniel’s dreams, which all begun with his father and the Dutch House. The characters were good, but not amazing. The prose, though, the prose! The writing style is breathtaking, and I can see why so many people love this book. I can savor each word, and I am sad the library did not have the book available for me to read along.

The plot progressed in random jumps... chapter ends, chapter start with first few lines with a new event. For a while I had the feeling Maeve and Celeste were in love before Maeve pushed her into Daniel. In the end, when all comes in full circle, it is truly a story about forgiveness at its very core. About how no one is exempt from mistakes and tragedy and that should not hold us from enjoying life, the way May always did. It feels May was the embodiment of the resolution. A clean slate for the family. Enjoying life, and not caring about the past, but about moving forward.
